\## SECTION 9 — Top-Down Dungeon Map Image Prompt



\### Purpose of the Section

Define a single image-generation prompt that renders a top-down dungeon map

as a direct visual translation of the Cartesian Map Specification.



\### Strict Rules (Non-Negotiable)

\- EXACTLY one image prompt.

\- Top-down view ONLY.

\- Resolution MUST be 1024x1024.

\- No labels, no text, no characters, no icons.

\- No perspective, no isometric view.



\### Required Style

\- Stylized fantasy dungeon map.

\- Textured stone / parchment / carved dungeon aesthetic.

\- Clean walls, doors, corridors clearly visible.

\- High contrast for readability.



\### Generation Order Constraint

The image prompt MUST be generated ONLY AFTER:

\- Cartesian Map Specification is finalized.

\- All spatial validations have passed.



\### Prompt Content Requirements

The prompt MUST:

\- Explicitly describe the dungeon as top-down.

\- Match room shapes, proportions, and connectivity.

\- Describe corridors and door placements.

\- Include architectural theme cues.

\- Include a subtle visual motif tied to the BBEG.

\- Specify resolution: 1024x1024.



\### Failure Conditions

\- Multiple prompts.

\- Conceptual or illustrative language.

\- Any mismatch with Cartesian Map Specification.
